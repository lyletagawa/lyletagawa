## Situation Behavior Impact

- in a specific scenario
  - here's what I saw: Especially good, especially bad, or neutral
  - effect on other people
  - here's what I would like you to change
  - example on where you did it

Giving feedback:

1. Situation
1. Behavior
1. Impact

## Situation

Define where and when. Put feedback into context

## Behavior

Describe the specific behaviors that you want to address.

You must not make assumptions or subjective judgments about those behaviors. These could be wrong, and this will undermine your feedback.

**Tip**: Aim to use measurable information in your description of the behavior. This helps to ensure that your comments are objective.

## Impact

Use "I" statements to describe how the other person's action has affected you or others.

For example:

> "During yesterday morning's team meeting, when you gave your presentation, you were uncertain about two of the slides and your sales calculations were incorrect. I felt embarrassed because the entire board was there. I'm worried that this has affected the reputation of our team."
