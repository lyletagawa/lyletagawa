## [The Dip](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324748.The_Dip) by [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/).

If it is worth doing, there is probably a Dip.

Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources. That's it.

The Dip is the difference between the easy "beginner" technique and the more useful "expert" approach.

The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value.

Never quit when panicked.

Seven reasons you might fail to become the best in the world:

- Run out of time (and quit)
- Run out of money (and quit)
- You get scared (and quit)
- You’re not serious about it (and quit)
- You lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre (and quit)
- You focus on the short term instead of the long (and quit when the short term gets too hard)
- You pick the wrong thing at which to be the best in the world (because you don’t have the talent)

The important thing to remember about these seven things is that you can plan for them.

Most of the time, if you fail to become the best in the world, it's either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal.
